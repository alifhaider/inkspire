# InkSpire

Where stories come to life

## Description

So this is not a fancy project. It's just prompting game. You run a program, instead of printing `"Hello World"` it just asks questions. And lets you navigate around different scenes of the game.

It's all about my learing.

## Setup

Clone the project

```
git clone git@github.com:alifhaider/inkspire.git
cd inkspire
```

And then

```
Cargo run
```
